		<h1>A brief history</h1>
		
		<h2>Greetings lads!</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				I've been doing things since 1999... maybe a little before, maybe a little after. In 2018 I started studying computer science at Piraeus University. There I begun to learn programming and mathematics, showed interest in the C language and its possibilities. My research interests focus on path finding algorithms. In the final year of my studies, I became interested in neural networks and their utilization in embedded systems. And so I decided to deal with such a topic in my thesis. Which was on the google's neural network accelerator Coral edge TPU. In February 2023 I got my degree with average score 7.62.
				<br>
				In September 2023, I applied to the University of Crete for a master's degree in robotics.
			</p>
			<p>
				During my studies I started teaching high school students computer science and mathematics. A "profession" which I can say was the best I have ever done. After university I got a job at a small web design agency where I was involved in designing the backend of websites. I left the position 4 months later, as I wanted to leave Athens and work in another field of science in smaller town. I am currently working as a quality assurance automation engineer.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my spare time I'll study psychology, write silly crime stories, go off-roading, and hike.
			</p>
			<p>
				Future goals is to study Psychology and learn physics
